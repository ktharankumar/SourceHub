**SourceHub** is a modern B2B platform that replaces manual spreadsheet tracking with an automated, data-driven workspace. It is built to handle the complexities of international trade, specifically focusing on the India-Europe-China sourcing corridors.

## ✨ Core Features

* **📄 AI Document Parser:** Drop any Chinese supplier's PDF quote or Excel sheet. SourceHub extracts SKUs, MOQs, Lead Times, and Incoterms automatically.
* **⚖️ The Comparison Matrix:** A side-by-side "Fight Sheet" that maps disparate supplier data into a unified view for instant decision-making.
* **🌍 Trade Compliance Intelligence:** Real-time insights into India-EU trade deals, assisting in duty calculations and regulatory compliance.
* **💬 Agentic Negotiation:** AI-drafted responses to suppliers based on competitive data and historical pricing.
* **📦 End-to-End Lifecycle:** Integrated tracking, automated invoice reconciliation, and wholesale order management.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

* **Backend:** Java 21 / Spring Boot (Microservices)
* **Frontend:** React (Vite) / Tailwind CSS / Lucide Icons
* **AI Layer:** LLM-based parsing (Claude/GPT-4o) + Semantic Clustering
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Core data) + Pinecone (Vector search for document history)
* **DevOps:** Dockerized services for seamless deployment on AWS/EC2.

## 🚀 Why SourceHub?

Traditional ERPs (SAP Ariba, Coupa) are too rigid and expensive for SME sourcing agents. SourceHub provides the "Prosumer" experience—combining the ease of a consumer app with the raw power of industrial-grade AI extraction.
